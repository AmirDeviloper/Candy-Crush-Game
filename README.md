# 🍬 Simple Candy Crush Game (.NET Framework)

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **June 2023** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This desktop game was built using **C# and .NET Framework**, inspired by the popular **Candy Crush** puzzle game. It features colorful tile matching, score tracking, and animated feedback. While functional, _**the current version includes minor bugs in the scoring logic**_ that are planned for future refinement.

The system includes:

- 🧩 **Match-3 Gameplay** – Swap tiles to form horizontal or vertical matches  
- 🎯 **Score Tracking** – Points awarded for valid matches (with known scoring bugs)  
- 🔄 **Randomized Board Generation** – Dynamic candy layout each round  
- 🕹️ **Mouse Interaction** – Drag-and-drop or click-based tile swapping
